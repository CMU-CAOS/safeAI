<h4 id="safe-ai-the-first-workshop-on-systems-and-architectures-for-encrypted-ai">SAFE-AI: The first workshop on Systems and Architectures for Encrypted AI</h4>

<p>This workshop on Encrypted AI will explore cutting-edge techniques for accelerating and democratizing privacy-preserving AI, focusing on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC). Designed in two parts, the workshop will first host sessions with invited speakers from academia and industry, who will share the latest advances in FHE for AI, real-world applications, and challenges in scaling encrypted AI.
The workshop will cover a broad range of topics on systems and architectures for encrypted AI including acceleration techniques across the computing stack, compilers, tools, DSLs, and applications for encrypted AI.</p>

<p>The second part of the workshop is a hands-on tutorial centered on the Cinnamon Framework for scale-out encrypted AI, providing participants with a comprehensive understanding of essential RTL design principles, architecture, compilers, DSL, and encrypted AI applications and models. Attendees will learn practical skills for creating, exploring, and deploying encrypted AI workflows, leveraging Cinnamonâ€™s modular approach to tackle the complexity of FHE on multi-chip systems. By the end of the workshop, participants will be equipped with tools and knowledge to scale AI models securely, integrate FHE into diverse AI applications, and bridge the gap between theoretical encryption techniques and practical, high-performance AI solutions. This event is ideal for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals invested in privacy-preserving AI.</p>

<h3 id="gpu-driven-fhe-real-time-private-ai-inference-competing-custom-asic">GPU-driven FHE: Real-Time Private AI Inference Competing Custom ASIC</h3>
<h4 id="abstract">Abstract</h4>
<p>A significant challenge in accelerating fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for practical applications is achieving high performance. DARPA, through the DPRIVE program in 2020, set a demanding performance target: running inference on a 7-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) against the CIFAR-10 dataset within 25ms. Using two H100 GPUs, we have achieved a remarkable 24.8ms latency with 87% accuracy without fabricating ASIC. This presentation will outline the series of techniques we have developed and leveraged since 2019 to accelerate CKKS, a widely adopted FHE scheme for machine learning. These techniques include low-degree polynomial approximation (AESPA), an agile CKKS GPU library (Cheddar), and advanced channel packing strategies inspired by HyPHEN and NeuJeans, all optimized for powerful GPUs.</p>

Professor Ahn is the hall of fame member of HPCA, ISCA, and MICRO.</p>

<h3 id="fast-and-accessible-fhe-secured-deep-learning-with-the-orion-compilation-framework">Fast and Accessible FHE-Secured Deep Learning with the Orion Compilation Framework</h3>
<h4 id="abstract-1">Abstract</h4>
<p>In this talk Iâ€™ll present an overview of my labâ€™s work on private neural inference over the last 5 years. This will include a brief overview of our neural network optimizations and various hardware accelerators. The core focus of the talk will be our new FHE neural network compiler named Orion, which will appear in the main ASPLOS conference. Orion automates and optimizes FHE, providing SOTA performance with a PyTorch programming model, making FHE more accessible than ever before! Iâ€™ll also explain how we pack vectors, leverage state-of-the-art FHE techniques, optimize level management and bootstrap placement, handle re-scaling, fit polynomial approximations, and deal with large data structures (e.g., weights and keys). To conclude, we will present a demo of our code and show how it can be used.</p>
<h4 id="speaker-brandon-reagen-new-york-university">Speaker: <a href="https://engineering.nyu.edu/faculty/brandon-reagen">Brandon Reagen (New York University)</a></h4>
<p><img src="img/brandon.png" alt="image" />
<br />
Dr. Reagen is a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University with a focus on computer architecture.

Prior to cryptographic computing, he made significant contributions to accelerator design and hardware for machine learning. The work has been recognized with multiple best paper nominations and Top Pick/honorable mention awards. He has further implemented many ideas, participating in multiple chip tape outs. He is actively a performer on the DARPA DPRIVE, PROWESS, and COOP programs, was recognized as a DARPA Riser in 2022, and won his NSF CAREER award in 2024. He has authored over 50 papers and holds one patent. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harvard, B.S. degrees in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics from UMass, Amherst.</p>

<h3 id="towards-unified-architectural-support-for-privacy-preserving-computing">Towards Unified Architectural Support for Privacy-Preserving Computing</h3>
<h4 id="abstract-2">Abstract</h4>
<p>Privacy-preserving computing involves several categories of cryptographic protocols such as fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), multi-party computation (MPC), and zero-knowledge proof (ZKP). In this talk I will start with our recent work that designed specialized accelerators for ZKP as well as functional units for ZKP and FHE. These efforts lead us to exploit the opportunities to design unified architectures that efficiently support not only largely varying parameters in each protocol, but also multiple different protocols. Considering the still rapid development of crypto protocols, such flexibility in hardware would be highly desired.</p>

<h3 id="heir-a-universal-compiler-for-fully-homomorphic-encryption">HEIR: A Universal Compiler for Fully Homomorphic Encryption</h3>
<h4 id="abstract-3">Abstract</h4>
<p>The HEIR project is a compiler toolchain for fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) that aims to incorporate all major techniques and algorithmic optimizations in FHE, accelerate FHE research, and lower the barrier to production FHE deployments. As a universal compiler, it aims to support any FHE scheme along with a set of extensible optimizations and generate code for any FHE hardware accelerator. With that goal, it can act as a common benchmarking platform for new research ideas and hardware accelerators. In this talk, weâ€™ll demonstrate how to use HEIRâ€™s python frontend to generate code for a variety of different platforms. Weâ€™ll also highlight some of the FHE techniques implemented in HEIR, such as data-oblivious program transformations, data layout optimization, relinearization placement, vectorization strategies, and more.</p>

<p><img src="img/asra.jpg" alt="image" />
<br />
Asra Ali is a software engineer at Google currently working on compilers for fully homomorphic encryption. Her track record includes developing and maintaining many open source projects around privacy and security, including Googleâ€™s Ring Learning with Errors implementation, Sigstoreâ€™s transparency log Rekor, and The Update Frameworkâ€™s Go module. Sheâ€™s also worked on real world privacy preserving applications using FHE, resulting in one patent. Her background is in abstract math, and published research in number theory.</p>
