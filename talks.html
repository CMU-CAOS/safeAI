### GPU-driven FHE: Real-Time Private AI Inference Competing Custom ASIC
#### Speaker: [Jung Ho Ahn (Seoul National University)](https://geniajh.github.io) 
#### Abstract
A significant challenge in accelerating fully homomorphic encryption (FHE) for practical applications is achieving high performance. DARPA, through the DPRIVE program in 2020, set a demanding performance target: running inference on a 7-layer convolutional neural network (CNN) against the CIFAR-10 dataset within 25ms. Using two H100 GPUs, we have achieved a remarkable 24.8ms latency with 87% accuracy without fabricating ASIC. This presentation will outline the series of techniques we have developed and leveraged since 2019 to accelerate CKKS, a widely adopted FHE scheme for machine learning. These techniques include low-degree polynomial approximation (AESPA), an agile CKKS GPU library (Cheddar), and advanced channel packing strategies inspired by HyPHEN and NeuJeans, all optimized for powerful GPUs.

\
Jung Ho Ahn is a professor at Seoul National University. Professor Ahn received his Ph.D. in electrical engineering from Stanford University (2007), was a senior research scientist at HP labs before joining Seoul National University, and took a sabbatical at Google (2016). His research interests include bridging the gap between the performance/efficiency demand of emerging applications (including homomorphic encryption) and the performance/efficiency potential of modern and future massively parallel systems, more specifically on memory subsystems. Professor Ahn is the hall of fame member of HPCA, ISCA, and MICRO.

Dr. Reagen is a professor of Electrical and Computer Engineering at New York University with a focus on computer architecture. He leads a group of 7 PhD students whose current focus is to make cryptographic computing practical through algorithmic, compiler, and hardware optimizations for homomorphic encryption, zero-knowledge proofs, and secure multi-party computation. Prior to cryptographic computing, he made significant contributions to accelerator design and hardware for machine learning. The work has been recognized with multiple best paper nominations and Top Pick/honorable mention awards. He has further implemented many ideas, participating in multiple chip tape outs. He is actively a performer on the DARPA DPRIVE, PROWESS, and COOP programs, was recognized as a DARPA Riser in 2022, and won his NSF CAREER award in 2024. He has authored over 50 papers and holds one patent. He holds a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Harvard, B.S. degrees in Computer Engineering and Applied Mathematics from UMass, Amherst.
