#### SAFE-AI: The first workshop on Systems and Architectures for Encrypted AI

This workshop on Encrypted AI will explore cutting-edge techniques for accelerating and democratizing privacy-preserving AI, focusing on Fully Homomorphic Encryption (FHE) and Secure Multi-party Computation (MPC). Designed in two parts, the workshop will first host sessions with invited speakers from academia and industry, who will share the latest advances in FHE for AI, real-world applications, and challenges in scaling encrypted AI.
The workshop will cover a broad range of topics on systems and architectures for encrypted AI including acceleration techniques across the computing stack, compilers, tools, DSLs, and applications for encrypted AI.

The second part of the workshop is a hands-on tutorial centered on the Cinnamon Framework for scale-out encrypted AI, providing participants with a comprehensive understanding of essential RTL design principles, architecture, compilers, DSL, and encrypted AI applications and models. Attendees will learn practical skills for creating, exploring, and deploying encrypted AI workflows, leveraging Cinnamonâ€™s modular approach to tackle the complexity of FHE on multi-chip systems. By the end of the workshop, participants will be equipped with tools and knowledge to scale AI models securely, integrate FHE into diverse AI applications, and bridge the gap between theoretical encryption techniques and practical, high-performance AI solutions. This event is ideal for researchers, engineers, and industry professionals invested in privacy-preserving AI.
